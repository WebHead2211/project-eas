# ETCH-A-SKETCH

The page loads with a 24*16 grid.

When the mouse first moves over the grid, the squares
take a random color (minimum possible value kept at
rgb(200,200,200) to keep it a lighter shade)

If the mouse is moved over a square again, the color gets
darker until eventually it becomes black.
